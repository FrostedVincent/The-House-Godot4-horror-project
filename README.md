# The-House-Godot4-horror-project
Just a horror game project that I work on (alone for the most part).  It's on public mostly because I have nothing to hide.


I needed to do this project because I really wanted for a while to do something on internet that I hope people will like...

I also felt (and still feel) really bad about some stuff in my life, and so I did a replica of my house for this project.
